       The ring is on my hand,<br>
         And the wreath is on my brow;<br>
       Satin and jewels grand<br>
       Are all at my command,<br>
         And I am happy now.<br>
<br>
       And my lord he loves me well;<br>
         But, when first he breathed his vow,<br>
       I felt my bosom swell-<br>
       For the words rang as a knell,<br>
       And the voice seemed his who fell<br>
       In the battle down the dell,<br>
         And who is happy now.<br>
<br>
       But he spoke to re-assure me,<br>
         And he kissed my pallid brow,<br>
       While a reverie came o'er me,<br>
       And to the church-yard bore me,<br>
       And I sighed to him before me,<br>
       Thinking him dead D'Elormie,<br>
       "Oh, I am happy now!"<br>
<br>
       And thus the words were spoken,<br>
         And this the plighted vow,<br>
       And, though my faith be broken,<br>
       And, though my heart be broken,<br>
       Here is a ring, as token<br>
         That I am happy now!<br>
<br>
       Would God I could awaken!<br>
         For I dream I know not how!<br>
       And my soul is sorely shaken<br>
       Lest an evil step be taken,-<br>
       Lest the dead who is forsaken<br>
         May not be happy now.
